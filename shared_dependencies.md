3. JsonWriterPipeline: This is a pipeline defined in "pipelines.py" that is used in "settings.py" and "linkedin_scraper.py" to handle the storage of scraped data in JSON format.

4. Settings: The settings defined in "settings.py" are used across all the other files to configure the behavior of the Scrapy spider.

5. LinkedInSpider: This is the main spider class defined in "linkedin_spider.py" and used in "linkedin_scraper.py" to handle the scraping process.

6. Middlewares: The middlewares defined in "middlewares.py" are used in "settings.py" and "linkedin_scraper.py" to handle the requests and responses.

7. DOM Elements: The id names of DOM elements that the LinkedInSpider will interact with are shared across "linkedin_scraper.py" and "linkedin_spider.py". These might include elements like 'profile', 'connections', 'experience', etc.

8. Output.json: This is the file where the scraped data is stored. It is used in "pipelines.py" and "linkedin_scraper.py".

9. __init__.py: This file is used to make Python treat the directories as containing packages. It is shared across all the other files.
